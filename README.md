Echo Server and Echo Client in Java
This repository contains the source code for a simple Echo Server and Echo Client written in Java.

Functionality
The Echo Server listens on a specified port and waits for incoming connections from clients.
When a client connects, the server echoes back any message received from the client.
The Echo Client connects to the server on the specified port and sends a message.
The client then displays the echoed message received from the server.
